        <h2>Dog Boarding</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of going to the kennels, your dog gets to go to someones else,
          often with other pets and people for company. Drop off and pick up
          options also available.

        <h2>Dog Sitting</h2>
        <p>
          Your dog gets the comfort and convenience of staying in their own
          home, as the sitter comes to yours! There is the added bonus of your
          home being looked after.
